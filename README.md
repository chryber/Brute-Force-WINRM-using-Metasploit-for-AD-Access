<h1>Brute Forcing Active Directory with Metasploit</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
Funny story how this lab began. I was actually attempting to set up another lab with Active Directory but could not remember the admin login I created initially. I kept trying generic passwords and ones that I used in the past but none could log me in. Frustrated, I tried recovery mode to see if I can get to the command prompt but that required my admin login as well. 🤦‍♂️
This situation got my wheels spinning. Can I crack my AD password? I began to look into this. I detailed the process and tools that I used below.
