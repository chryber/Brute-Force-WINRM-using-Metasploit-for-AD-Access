<h1>Brute Forcing Active Directory with Metasploit</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
Funny story how this lab began. I was actually attempting to set up another lab with Active Directory but could not remember the admin login I created initially. I kept trying generic passwords and ones that I used in the past but none could log me in. Frustrated, I tried recovery mode to see if I can get to the command prompt but that required my admin login as well. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This situation got my wheels spinning. Can I crack my AD password? I began to look into this and finally got it with a little help which will be discussed later on. Follow along after setting up AD and Kali or just read through my process on how dangerous it is to use weak passwords. I detailed the process and tools that I used below. Check out my first AD project or Jason Makador's Youtube tutorial on how to create the homelab.

<h2>üî© Utlities Used</h2>

- Windows Server 2019 üíª (target)
- Virtual Box üß∞
- Kali Purple üêâ (attacker)

<h2>‚ôªÔ∏è The Process</h2>

1. Deep thought: How can I crack my password? In Windows, the password hashes are stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM. SAM is the Windows Security Accounts Manager. For obvious security purposes, this database cannot be accessed unless you have system priveleges and HLK/SAM access. Without getting to deep into Windows internals, I am on the outside so I can't even get to this file to extract the hashes to run through tools like Hashcat. My next thought: why not try brute forcing it?

2. Planning: I am familiar with tools like John the Ripper and Hydra for password cracking. I also recalled Burpsuite can be used to brute force logins from my ethical hacking course. I kept those tools in mind but first I needed to put Kali and the Server 2019 machine on the same network.

3. Network: VirtualBox has a variety of options under the Network setting for each machine. Most if not all of my machines are set to NatNetwork which I created as a default. I also created a ChryberHomeLab Natnetwork recently as well. A NatNetwork is an internal network that accepts outbound connections. In VirtualBox, Click Tools < Network < NAT Networks < Create < Enter network name < Enter IPv4 address (mine is a /24 network to allow for 254 hosts) < Enable DHCP (unless you want to assign IP addresses to each machine yourself) < Apply. Note: This should not be the same IP address as your host machine. I recommend using 'ipconfig' on your host machine command line and confirm your ip address.

4. Set up: Moving AD and Kali into the same subnet. Click machine < Settings < Network < Attached to: NAT Network < Name: ChryberHomeLab (in my case).

5. IP address locator: Now that the attack machine (Kali) and the target (Server 2019) are on on the same network, my next thought was how I can
